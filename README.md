# Instagram_Follower_Webscraper
The Instagram Follower Web scraper is a program written in python, which makes it possible to make follower leaves visible. Furthermore it helps to keep track of your followers with a follower list and a follower accession file.
Features like the "status" make the waiting time even more relaxed and clearer. ;)

# Visual_Statistics
The Visual Statistics "AddOn" shows your data visualized.
With it you can anaylize your data in a simple way.

# Follower_Comparison
The Follower Comparison "AddOn" compares two different txt-files for you.
The txt-files must be filled with follower names one below the other for the correct reading of the data.
