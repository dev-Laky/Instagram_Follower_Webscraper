# Instagram_Follower_Webscraper
The Instagram Follower Web scraper is a program written in python, which makes it possible to make follower leaves visible. Furthermore it helps to keep track of your followers with a follower list and a follower accession file.
Features like the "status" make the waiting time even more relaxed and clearer. ;)
